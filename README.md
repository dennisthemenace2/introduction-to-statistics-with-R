# introduction-to-statistics-with-R
This is a lecture I created as part of a teaching assignment.

This repository contains the lecture slides and programming exercises. It consists of 10 sets of slides with programming exercises for each set.
The exercises are used to provide a better understanding and practical application of the topics discusses in the slides.

The lecture largely follows the book: Introductory Statistics by Douglas Shafer, University of North Carolina:
