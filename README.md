# introduction-to-statistics-with-R
This is a lecture I created as part of a teaching assignment.

Most of the martial is used from the book Introductory Statistics by Douglas Shafer, University of North Carolina:
https://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Introductory%20Statistics.pdf


The code are mostly implementations of the exercises from the book and additional things that are meant to help understanding the statistics better.
